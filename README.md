MalBen-BCC: Malignant & Benign Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms
</h1>

---

## 📝 Abstract

<div align="justify">

This project focuses on classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign using supervised machine learning and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Utilizing the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, the study analyzes 30 features extracted from digitized biopsy images. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training, both traditional ML classifiers and a custom-built neural network are evaluated.

The objective is to support early diagnosis by maximizing prediction accuracy while minimizing false negatives, which are critical in life-threatening conditions like cancer. This implementation aims to provide an intelligent diagnostic assistance tool using interpretable, efficient, and replicable machine learning solutions.
